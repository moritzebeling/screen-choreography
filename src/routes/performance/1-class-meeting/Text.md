One thing about programming as a tool for creating visual images is, that the result we see is being created in that very moment.

When looking at other forms of media: a video, a painting, a static design, production and presentation are inherently separated processes.

Through the continuous iteration of computing and rendering, a programmed visual can be altered by input that is being created or updated during runtime, meaning that the image can be reactive to the situation in which it is also being consumed.

Another thing about programming is that logic can be implemented in any layer, position and time step.

With logic, a changing input variable can be transformed into behavior.

Another thing about programming is that scale can be achieved comparatively easily.

When spreading behavior logic, a system of individual agents can be created, each executing their own input variables in real time. Encapsulated or in cooperation with their peer agents, they form complex networks.

These could be pixels on a screen, devices in a circle, people in a room.

All orchestrated by the algorithm.
